## Introduction

Real estate is all about location, location, location. This project dives into the world of housing data to predict prices based on various features, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Preprocessing

### Load and Clean

We start by loading data from CSV files and meticulously cleaning it to ensure data quality. We remove mistakes and discrepancies that might affect our models' performance.

### Encoding

To work with statistical models, we encode categorical data and ensure our features are in a format that our algorithms can understand.

### Handling Missing Values

Missing data can be problematic. We fill in missing values where appropriate, so our models have all the information they need.

## Modeling

We don't stop at preprocessing. Our project includes the following models:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To squeeze out the best performance from our models, we fine-tune their hyperparameters. We're dedicated to finding the optimal configuration for each algorithm.

## Choosing the Best Model

With a set of well-tuned models in hand, we embark on the journey to choose the ultimate house price predictor. We compare the models' performance and select the one that shines the brightest.
